This is a section of a project for which I was responsible. It is a dashboard that displays information for a single worker. It includes four categories of data:  

* Worker Information (name, contact info, etc. received via REST API)
* Tag Data (data from wearable, received via web sockets)
* Notifications (data from web service via pub/sub service that was never completed)
* Trends (historical tag data retrieved via REST API that was never completed)

NOTE: This is a sample of code separated from a larger project. This directory does not contain all modules/files that may appear.
